A wampy Application
===================

This is a fully fledged example of a wampy application that implements all 4 WAMP Roles: caller, callee, publisher and subscriber.

::

    from wampy.peers.clients import Client
    from wampy.roles import callee
    from wampy.roles import subscriber


    class WampyApp(Client):

        @callee
        def get_weather(self, *args, **kwargs):
            weather = self.call("another.example.app.endpoint")
            return weather

        @subscribe(topic="global-weather")
        def weather_events(self, weather_data):
            # process weather data here
            self.publish(topic="wampy-weather", message=weather_data)


Here the method decorated by @callee is a callable remote procedure. In this example, it also acts as a Caller, by calling another remote procedure and then returning the result.

And the method decorated by @subscribe implements the Subscriber Role, and when it receives an Event it then acts as a Publisher, and publishes a new message to a topic.

Note that the ``call`` and ``publish`` APIs are provided by the super class, ``Client``.

Running The Application
-----------------------

**wampy** provides a command line interface tool to start the application.

::

    $ wampy run path.to.your.module.including.module_name:WampyApp


For example, running one of the **wampy** example applications.

::

    $ wampy run docs.examples.services:BinaryNumberService --config './wampy/testing/configs/crossbar.config.ipv4.json'
